# Sentry Build Workshop Guide

This repository contains the documentation and guide for the **Fullstack Performance and Debugging** workshop, built using [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

## About the Workshop

Sentry Build is a comprehensive hands-on workshop that teaches developers how to implement complete observability in **Vite + React + React Router 7 frontend** and **Node.js backend** JavaScript applications. The workshop covers:

- Setting up distributed tracing across fullstack JavaScript applications
- Implementing custom metrics and performance monitoring
- Instrumenting databases, queues, and caches for complete visibility
- Creating actionable alerts and dashboards
- Using Sentry's visualization tools for debugging and optimization
- Best practices for production-ready observability

## Workshop Content

The workshop content is organized into 4 comprehensive modules:

1. **Getting Started with Tracing and Logs** - Set up Sentry tracing and logging in your Vite frontend and Bun backend application.
2. **Instrumenting Span Attributes, Metrics, and Alerts** - Learn to add custom spans, attributes, and metrics to track your application's behavior.
3. **Tracing Database, Queues, and Caches** - Instrument database queries, background jobs, and caching layers for complete visibility.
4. **Visualizing Traces in Sentry** - Master Sentry's trace visualization tools to debug performance issues and optimize your application.
