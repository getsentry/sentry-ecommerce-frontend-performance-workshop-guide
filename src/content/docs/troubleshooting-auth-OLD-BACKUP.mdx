The application is up and running but when you try to sign in, you're getting an error. These errors show up in Sentry, which is great, but how can we use [**Tracing**](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans) and [**Logs**](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/logs/) to help troubleshoot the issue?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Create **Custom Spans** that will track specific attributes within your application
- Use **Trace Explorer** to search for specific spans that match issues in your environment
- Explore trace waterfalls to understand where in the trace issue happens
- Implement logs in your application to give you more context around the issues happening within your application
- Search and review logs to help troubleshoot issues in your application

## Frontend Implementation

Let's start by instrumenting the frontend authentication flow to track login attempts and user credential processing.

<Steps>
  1. **Add Sentry Import to Frontend Login Component**

     Navigate to the `/apps/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` file and add the Sentry import at the top:

     ```tsx
     import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
     ```

2. **Set Up Frontend Logging**

   Add the logger destructuring after your imports to access Sentry's logging functionality:

   ```tsx
   const { logger } = Sentry;
   ```

3. **Replace the Complete handleSSO Function**

   Replace the entire 'handleSSO' function with this instrumented version:

   ```tsx
   const handleSSO = async (provider: string) => {
     setError('');
     setIsLoading(true);

     try {
       await Sentry.startSpan(
         {
           name: 'sso.authentication.frontend',
           op: 'auth.sso',
           attributes: {
             'auth.provider': provider,
           },
         },
         async (span) => {
           const userCredentials = fetchSSOUserCredentials(provider);

           logger.info(
             logger.fmt`Logging user ${userCredentials.email} in using ${provider}`
           );

           span.setAttributes({
             'auth.user.id': userCredentials.id,
             'auth.user.email': userCredentials.email,
             'auth.user.name': userCredentials.name,
             'auth.user.avatar': userCredentials.avatar,
           });

           const loginSignature = createAuthenticationToken(
             userCredentials,
             provider
           );

           span.setAttributes({
             'auth.login_signature.defined':
               loginSignature !== undefined && loginSignature !== null,
           });

           await ssoLogin(provider);
         }
       );

       navigate('/');
     } catch (err: any) {
       logger.error(
         logger.fmt`Failed to login with ${provider} - issue with loginSignature`
       );
       setError(`Failed to login with ${provider} - issue with loginSignature`);
       throw err;
     } finally {
       setIsLoading(false);
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Test Frontend Tracing**

   Try logging in again. In Sentry, navigate to **Explore > Traces** in Sentry's left navigation menu, and search using the `span.description` filter with `sso.authentication.frontend` as the value. You can type this in full or choose the `span.description is` filter below the input to streamline the workflow.

   <ScaledImage
     src="/assets/img/m1-trace-explorer-fe.png"
     alt="Trace Explorer FE"
     size={100}
   />

5. **Examine the Trace**

   Clicking into one of the spans will show you the trace waterfall where you can examine the properties of any of he spans submitted.

   <ScaledImage
     src="/assets/img/m1-span-waterfall-fe.png"
     alt="Trace Waterfall"
   />

6. **Examine the Logs**

   Check the **Explore > Logs** tab for the log entries created by `logger.info` and `logger.error` calls.

</Steps>

## Backend Implementation

Now let's instrument the backend authentication flow to trace the server-side processing and identify where the issue occurs.

<Steps>
  1. **Add Sentry Import to Backend Auth Routes**

     Navigate to the `/apps/server/modules/auth/routes.ts` file and add the Sentry import at the top:

     ```tsx
     import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';
     ```

2. **Set Up Backend Logging**

   Add the logger destructuring after your imports:

   ```tsx
   const { logger } = Sentry;
   ```

3. **Replace the Complete SSO Route**

   Replace the entire `authRoutes.post('/sso/:provider'` route with this instrumented version:

   ```tsx
   authRoutes.post('/sso/:provider', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const { provider } = req.params;
       const { loginSignature } = req.body;

       await Sentry.startSpan(
         {
           name: 'sso.authentication.server',
           op: 'auth.sso.verify',
           attributes: {
             'auth.provider': provider,
             'auth.login_signature.provided': !!loginSignature,
             'http.method': req.method,
             'http.route': '/sso/:provider',
           },
         },
         async (span) => {
           logger.info(logger.fmt`SSO login attempt with ${provider}`);
           logger.info(
             logger.fmt`Login signature provided: ${!!loginSignature}`
           );

           // Add more attributes based on request data
           span.setAttributes({
             'auth.request.body_size': JSON.stringify(req.body).length,
             'auth.request.has_signature': loginSignature !== undefined,
           });

           // TOFIX Module 1: SSO Login with missing login signature
           const signaturePayload = JSON.parse(atob(loginSignature)); // This will throw when loginSignature is undefined

           // Add signature payload details to span
           span.setAttributes({
             'auth.signature.user_id': signaturePayload.sub || null,
             'auth.signature.email': signaturePayload.email || null,
             'auth.signature.name': signaturePayload.name || null,
             'auth.signature.provider': signaturePayload.provider || null,
             'auth.signature.issued_at': signaturePayload.iat || null,
             'auth.signature.expires_at': signaturePayload.exp || null,
             'auth.signature.has_user_data': !!signaturePayload.userData,
           });

           // Use the rich fake user data from the signature payload, with sensible defaults
           const fakeUserData = signaturePayload.userData || {};

           // Add user data details to span
           span.setAttributes({
             'auth.user.id': fakeUserData.id || null,
             'auth.user.email': fakeUserData.email || null,
             'auth.user.name': fakeUserData.name || null,
             'auth.user.company': fakeUserData.company || null,
             'auth.user.job_title': fakeUserData.jobTitle || null,
           });

           const ssoUser = {
             id: fakeUserData.id || createId(),
             email: fakeUserData.email || `${provider}.user@example.com`,
             name:
               fakeUserData.name ||
               `${provider.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + provider.slice(1)} User`,
             firstName: fakeUserData.firstName || 'Demo',
             lastName: fakeUserData.lastName || 'User',
             username: fakeUserData.username || 'demo.user',
             avatar:
               fakeUserData.avatar ||

             company: fakeUserData.company || 'Demo Company',
             jobTitle: fakeUserData.jobTitle || 'Software Developer',

             signatureClaims: {
               sub: signaturePayload.sub,
               exp: signaturePayload.exp,
               metadata: {
                 permissions: [],
                 roles: [],
               },
             },
             socialProfile: {
               profileImage:
                 fakeUserData.avatar ||
                 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/220453/pexels-photo-220453.jpeg',
               verified: true,
               provider: provider,
             },
             linkedAccounts: [
               {
                 provider: provider,
                 externalId: signaturePayload.sub,
                 profile: {
                   username:
                     fakeUserData.username ||
                     (
                       fakeUserData.email ||
                       signaturePayload.email ||
                       'user'
                     ).split('@')[0],
                   avatar:
                     fakeUserData.avatar ||
                     'https://images.pexels.com/photos/220453/pexels-photo-220453.jpeg',
                 },
               },
             ],
           };

           // Add final authentication result to span
           span.setAttributes({
             'auth.result.user_id': ssoUser.id,
             'auth.result.success': true,
             'auth.result.provider_verified': true,
           });

           const responseData = {
             user: ssoUser,
             token: `sso-token-${createId()}`,
             expiresIn: '24h',
           };

           logger.info(logger.fmt`Successful SSO login with ${provider}`);
           res.json(responseData);
         }
       );
     } catch (error: any) {
       Sentry.captureException(error, {
         tags: {
           operation: 'sso.authentication.backend',
           provider: req.params.provider,
         },
         extra: {
           provider: req.params.provider,
           hasLoginSignature: !!req.body.loginSignature,
           requestBody: req.body,
         },
       });

       logger.error(
         logger.fmt`SSO login error for ${req.params.provider}:`,
         error
       );

       throw error;
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Test Backend Tracing**

   Try logging in again and observe the trace and logs by viewing the **Explore > Traces** and using the Trace Explorer to search for `sso.authentication.server`.

   <ScaledImage
     src="/assets/img/m1-trace-explorer-be.png"
     alt="Trace Explorer BE"
     size={100}
   />

5. **Examine the Trace**

   Clicking into one of the spans will show you the trace waterfall where you can examine the properties of any of he spans submitted.

   <ScaledImage
     src="/assets/img/m1-span-waterfall-be.png"
     alt="Trace Waterfall"
   />

6. **Examine the Logs**

   <ScaledImage src="/assets/img/m1-logs-be.png" alt="Logs" />

</Steps>

You should now see the complete authentication flow traced from frontend to backend, and notice that the loginSignature is being created on the frontend but not being passed properly to the server.

When we explore these traces and logs, we can see an inconsistency - the loginSignature is being created on the frontend, but not being passed properly to the server.

## A little help from Seer

Tracing and Logs have given us a lot of information about the issue and a pretty clear path on the things that need to be fixed - but it still took us manually digging into the results to find the issue.

What if we could have Sentry tell us exactly what broke, and where? Enter Seer, Sentry's AI Agent for debugging.

<ScaledImage src="/assets/img/seerclick.png" alt="Seer" />

Seer uses your codebase, traces, logs, and the stack traces in your application to understand better context about what's going wrong in your application.

Instead of you having to manually dig through the results, Seer analyzes all of these sources and gives you a clear path to the issue.

<Steps>

1. **Click Find Root Cause**

   This opens the Seer modal and gives you a high level of of what's happening and the initial guess over what might be wrong.

2. **Enable Seer Automation settings in your Sentry Project(s)**

   In Sentry, visit Project ➡️ Settings ➡️ Seer and add your repo. We'll do this for both the Frontend and Server applications.

   Here we can fine-tune the automation settings for how we want Seer to work. Scan Sentry Issues for a root cause analysis... and then? 🤖

   <ScaledImage
     src="/assets/img/seer-project-settings.png"
     alt="Seer Settings"
     size={100}
   />

3. **Select Start Seer**

   You can give Seer additional context in the text field within the Seer modal, and then click the **Start Seer** button to start the analysis.

</Steps>
### Analysis in progress

You'll be able to watch the progress of Seer as it reviews your codebase and the issue content described above. If you notice areas that are inaccurate, you can select the findings and provide additional context to help Seer understand the issue better.

<ScaledImage src="/assets/img/SeerAnalysis.png" alt="Seer Analysis" />

### Seer's Root Cause Analysis

As Seer progresses through the analysis, it will find multiple points to support a root cause analysis. You can interact with the these items as they are found. This allows you to potentially discard findings that are not actually relevant to the root cause analysis, or provide additional context to help Seer find more relevant root cause items as it progresses.

<ScaledImage src="/assets/img/SeerRootCause.png" alt="Seer Root Cause" />

### Solution - Code it Up!

Once the root cause is determined, Seer will provide a suggested solution, and which code in your application should be modified to support correcting the issue. You can select the "Code it Up" option for it to write up the detailed changes.

<ScaledImage src="/assets/img/SeerSolutionCode.png" alt="Seer Code It Up" />

There is a small copy icon next to Code it Up that can be used to copy a summary that can be pasted into external systems (i.e. LLMs) to help implement the suggested changes.

### Fix Implementation

Once "Code it Up" has finished, you'll see the exact changes that need to be made in the application and the option to draft a PR to have Seer implement the changes for you in your GitHub repo. In our case, the `ssoLogin` function is missing an additional parameter that is required to be passed to the function.

<ScaledImage src="/assets/img/SeerCodeChange.png" alt="Seer Code Change" />

Make these changes in `LoginForm.tsx` by changing the line:

```javascript
await ssoLogin(provider);
```

to:

```javascript
await ssoLogin(provider, loginSignature);
```

And attempt the login again. You should be greeted with the landing page of Sentry Academy.
