Sentry recently released Prevent AI, which gives you AI-powered code review and test generation capabilities directly in your GitHub workflow. This feature gives you several new capabilities:

- Direct integration with GitHub pull requests through the Seer by Sentry app
- AI-powered code review that analyzes your changes and suggests improvements
- Automatic test generation for uncovered code paths
- Security vulnerability detection and performance optimization suggestions
- Only runs when explicitly triggered, ensuring it doesn't interfere with your development flow

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Implement a new AI feature using OpenAI function calling for course creation
- Create a pull request for your new feature
- Install and configure Sentry Prevent AI for automated PR review
- Use AI-powered code review and test generation to improve code quality
- Understand how to integrate AI development tools into your workflow

Getting started with AI-powered PR review is straightforward. We need to...

- Implement a new feature that adds value to our application
- Create a pull request with our changes
- Install the Seer by Sentry GitHub app and enable the necessary features
- Test the AI review capabilities in action

## Implementing the Course Creation AI Tool

We already have a basic course creation feature in Sentry Academy, but let's enhance it with better OpenAI function calling and proper Sentry instrumentation.

<Steps>
  1. **Generate our new tool call**

     We're going to have a little bit of fun with code generation! First, provide the following prompt in your IDE like Cursor... 

     ```text
      I need to add a new tool call to my application to handle course generation. This tool call should use structure like the following, and create a new course in my project using the chat interface. 
     ```

     And paste the following tool call below your prompt. We do this to give the LLM a structure to understand how to use. In a few moments, it should produce a new chat endpoint. 

     ```tsx
     // Add this enhanced function calling definition
     const tools = [
       {
         type: 'function' as const,
         function: {
           name: 'create_structured_course',
           description: 'Create a comprehensive course with detailed modules and lessons',
           parameters: {
             type: 'object',
             properties: {
               title: {
                 type: 'string',
                 description: 'Engaging course title that clearly describes the learning outcome'
               },
               description: {
                 type: 'string',
                 description: 'Comprehensive course description explaining what students will learn'
               },
               category: {
                 type: 'string',
                 description: 'Course category (e.g., Programming, Design, Business)'
               },
               estimatedHours: {
                 type: 'number',
                 description: 'Total estimated hours to complete the course'
               },
               modules: {
                 type: 'array',
                 description: 'Array of course modules',
                 items: {
                   type: 'object',
                   properties: {
                     title: { type: 'string', description: 'Module title' },
                     description: { type: 'string', description: 'Module overview' },
                     lessons: {
                       type: 'array',
                       items: {
                         type: 'object',
                         properties: {
                           title: { type: 'string', description: 'Lesson title' },
                           objectives: {
                             type: 'array',
                             items: { type: 'string' },
                             description: 'Learning objectives for this lesson'
                           },
                           estimatedMinutes: { type: 'number', description: 'Estimated completion time' }
                         },
                         required: ['title', 'objectives', 'estimatedMinutes']
                       }
                     }
                   },
                   required: ['title', 'description', 'lessons']
                 }
               }
             },
             required: ['title', 'description', 'category', 'estimatedHours', 'modules']
           }
         }
       }
     ];
     ```

2. **Test the Enhanced Course Creation**

   Navigate to the Course Builder in Sentry Academy and create a new course with a prompt like:

<Steps>
  1. **Commit Your Changes**

     First, stage and commit your enhanced course creation feature (and while we're at it, everything else). From the root of the project, run the following commands (you can also do this in your IDE from the source control tab):

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Enhance course creation with structured function calling and improved Sentry instrumentation"
     ```

2. **Push to a Feature Branch**

   Create and push a feature branch for our improvements:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/enhanced-course-creation
   git push -u origin feature/enhanced-course-creation
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request**

   Navigate to your GitHub repository and create a new pull request from the `feature/enhanced-course-creation` branch to `main`. Include a detailed description of your changes:

   ```markdown

4. **Review Generated Test Code**

   The AI will provide a link to view the generated tests, which might include:

   ```typescript
   describe('Enhanced Course Creation', () => {
     it('should create structured course with function calling', async () => {
       // Test implementation for successful course creation
     });

     it('should handle OpenAI API errors gracefully', async () => {
       // Test error handling scenarios
     });

     it('should validate input prompts properly', async () => {
       // Test input validation
     });
   });
   ```
