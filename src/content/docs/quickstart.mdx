Follow this guide to get up and running with the workshop environment in the fastest way possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended package manager)

Additionally, you'll need a Sentry account to follow along with the performance and error monitoring portions of this workshop:

- [Sign up for a free Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/) if you don't already have an account

:::tip[Pro Tip]
We recommend setting up two separate projects in your Sentry account: one for the frontend (React) and one for the backend (Node.js). This allows you to efficiently monitor each project more clearly. We'll be configuring our SDKs in the workshop, so all you need to do is create the new projects and have your DSNs handy.

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
1. **Fork the repository**

     Go to [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ecommerce-frontend-performance-workshop-app](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ecommerce-frontend-performance-workshop-app) and click the "Fork" button in the top right. We'll fork instead of cloning so we can use Sentry's Seer AI to open PRs with performance fixes.

2. **Clone your fork into a directory we're going to call `unborked`**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sentry-ecommerce-frontend-performance-workshop-app.git unborked
   cd unborked
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   The project uses a turborepo monorepo structure with `apps/web` (frontend) and `apps/api` (backend). Each has an `.env.example` file you can copy:

   #### Frontend (`apps/web/.env`):

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   ```

   Edit `apps/web/.env` and configure (we'll add Sentry DSN later):

   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

   #### Backend (`apps/api/.env`):

   **Automatic Database setup**

   If you want to spin up a temporary Postgres database using Neon, you can run the following command from the root of the repo:

   ```baseh
   pnpm db:new
   ```

   This will generate a `.env` file inside `apps/api` with a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You can claim it to your account later if you want, but it's a good playground to have for this workshop.

   **Manual DB Setup**

   ```bash
   cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
   ```

   Edit `apps/api/.env` and add your database connection string (use a local PostgreSQL instance or a hosted service like [Neon](https://neon.tech) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com)):

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/unborked
   ```

5. **Run database migrations and seed data**

   From the root `unborked` directory:

   ```bash
   pnpm migrate
   pnpm seed
   ```

6. **Start the development servers**

   This single command starts both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**

   The project will now be running:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

</Steps>

## What's Available After Setup

Once you've completed the setup, you'll have access to:

- **E-commerce Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript application with product browsing, cart, and checkout
- **Backend API**: Node.js + Express with Drizzle ORM connected to PostgreSQL
- **Full-Stack Application**: Ready for Sentry performance and error monitoring instrumentation

This setup will allow you to progress through the workshop and start implementing Sentry. This workshop will take you through setting up **Performance Monitoring, Web Vitals tracking, Error Monitoring, Session Replay, Distributed Tracing**, and building production-ready dashboards and alerts!
